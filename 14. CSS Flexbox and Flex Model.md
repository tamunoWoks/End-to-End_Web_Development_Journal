### Introduction to CSS Flexbox and Flex Model
- **Definition:** CSS flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to arrange elements in rows and columns within a container.
- **Flex Model:** This model defines how flex items are arranged within a flex container. Every flex container has two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.

### The `flex-direction` Property
- **Definition:** This property sets the direction of the main axis. The default value of `flex-direction` is `row`, which places all the flex items on the same row, in the direction of your browser's default language (left to right or right to left).
- **`flex-direction: row-reverse;`:** This reverses the items in the row.
- **`flex-direction: column;`:** This will align the flex items vertically instead of horizontally.
- **`flex-direction: column-reverse;`:** This reverses the order of the flex items vertically.

### The `flex-wrap` Property
- **Definition:** This property determines how flex items are wrapped within a flex container to fit the available space. `flex-wrap` can take three possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.
- **`flex-wrap: nowrap;`:** This is the default value. Flex items won't be wrapped onto a new line, even if their width exceed the container's width.
- **`flex-wrap: wrap;`:** This property will wrap the items when they exceed the width of their container.
- **`flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;`:** This property will wrap flex items in reverse order.
- **`flex-flow` Property:** This property is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.
```css
flex-flow: column wrap-reverse;
```
