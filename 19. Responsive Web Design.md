### Responsive Web Design
- **Definition:** The core principle of responsive design is adaptability – the ability of a website to adjust its layout and content based on the screen size and capabilities of the device it's being viewed on.
- **Fluid grids:** These use relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels, allowing content to resize and reflow based on screen size.
- **Flexible images:** These are set to resize within their containing elements, ensuring they don't overflow their containers on smaller screens.
### Media Queries
- **Definition:** This allows developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, primarily the viewport width.
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens at least 768px wide */
}
```
