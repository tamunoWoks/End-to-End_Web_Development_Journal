### Responsive Web Design
- **Definition:** The core principle of responsive design is adaptability – the ability of a website to adjust its layout and content based on the screen size and capabilities of the device it's being viewed on.
- **Fluid grids:** These use relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels, allowing content to resize and reflow based on screen size.
- **Flexible images:** These are set to resize within their containing elements, ensuring they don't overflow their containers on smaller screens.
### Media Queries
- **Definition:** This allows developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, primarily the viewport width.
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens at least 768px wide */
}
```
- **`all` Media Type:** This is suitable for all devices. This is the default if no media type is specified.
- **`print` Media Types:** This is intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode.
- **`screen` Media Types:** This is intended primarily for screens.
- **`aspect-ratio`:** This describes the ratio between the width and height of the viewport.
```css
@media screen and (aspect-ratio: 16/9) {
  /* Styles for screens with a 16:9 aspect ratio */
}
```
- **`orientation`:** This is used to indicate whether the device is in landscape or portrait orientation.
```css
@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  /* Styles for landscape orientation */
}
```
