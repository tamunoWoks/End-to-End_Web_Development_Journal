### Accessibility Tree
Accessibility tree is a structure used by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interpret and interact with the content on a webpage.

### `max()` Function
The `max()` function returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values:
```css
img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
```
In the above example, the width of the image will be 250px if the viewport width is less than 1000 pixels. If the viewport width is greater than 1000 pixels, the width of the image will be 25vw. This is because 25vw is equal to 25% of the viewport width.
