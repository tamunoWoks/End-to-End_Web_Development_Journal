### Introduction to Typography
- **Definition:** Typography is the art of choosing the right fonts and format to make text visually appealing and easy to read. "Type" refers to how the individual characters are designed and arranged.
- **Typeface Definition:** A typeface is the overall design and style of a set of characters, numbers, and symbols. It's like a blueprint for a family of fonts.
- **Font Definition:** A font is a specific variation of a typeface with specific characteristics, such as size, weight, style, and width.
- **Serif Typeface:** This typeface has a classical style with small lines at the end of characters. Serif typefaces are commonly used for printed materials, like books.
- **Sans Serif Typeface:** This typeface has a more modern look, without the small lines at the end of characters. Sans Serif typefaces are commonly used in digital design because they are easy to read on screen. Some examples include Helvetica, Arial, and Roboto.
- **Font Weight:** This is the thickness of the characters, including light, regular, bold, and black.
- **Font Style:** This is the slant and orientation of the characters, like italic and oblique.
- **Font Width:** This is the horizontal space occupied by characters, like condensed and expanded.
- **Baseline:** This is the imaginary line on which most characters rest.
- **Cap Height:** This is the height of uppercase letters, measured from the baseline to the top.
- **X-height:** This is the average height of lowercase letters, excluding ascenders and descenders.
- **Ascenders:** These are the parts of lowercase letters that extend above the x-height, such as the tops of the letters 'h', 'b', 'd', and 'f'.
- **Descenders:** These are the parts of lowercase letters that extend below the baseline, such as the tails of 'y', 'g', 'p', and 'q'.
- **Kerning:** This is how space is adjusted between specific pairs of characters to improve their readability and aesthetics. For example, reducing the space between the letters A and V.
- **Tracking:** This is how space is adjusted between all characters in a block of text. It's essentially the distance between the characters. It affects how dense and open the text will be.
- **Leading:** This is the vertical space between lines of text. It's measured from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next line.
- **Best Practices with Typography:** You should choose clear and simple fonts to make your designs easy to understand. This is particularly important for the main text of your website. Users are more likely to engage with your content if the font is easy to read. You should use two or three fonts at most to create a visual consistency. Using too many fonts can make the text more difficult to read and weaken your brand's identity. This can also impact the user experience by increasing the load time of the website. You can use font size to create a visual hierarchy for headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and other elements. For example, the main heading on a webpage should have a larger font, followed by subheadings with smaller font sizes. This will give every element in the hierarchy a specific font size that helps users navigate through the structure visually.

### CSS `font-family` Property
- **Definition:** A font family is a group of fonts that share a common design. All the fonts that belong to the same family are based on the same core typeface but they also have variations in their style, weight, and width. You can specify multiple font families in order of priority, from highest to lowest, by separating them with commas. These alternative fonts will act as fallback options. You should always include a generic font family at the end of the font-family list.
```css
font-family: Arial, Lato;
```
