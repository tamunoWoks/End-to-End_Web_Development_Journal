### Introduction to Typography
- **Definition:** Typography is the art of choosing the right fonts and format to make text visually appealing and easy to read. "Type" refers to how the individual characters are designed and arranged.
- **Typeface Definition:** A typeface is the overall design and style of a set of characters, numbers, and symbols. It's like a blueprint for a family of fonts.
- **Font Definition:** A font is a specific variation of a typeface with specific characteristics, such as size, weight, style, and width.
- **Serif Typeface:** This typeface has a classical style with small lines at the end of characters. Serif typefaces are commonly used for printed materials, like books.
- **Sans Serif Typeface:** This typeface has a more modern look, without the small lines at the end of characters. Sans Serif typefaces are commonly used in digital design because they are easy to read on screen. Some examples include Helvetica, Arial, and Roboto.
- **Font Weight:** This is the thickness of the characters, including light, regular, bold, and black.
- **Font Style:** This is the slant and orientation of the characters, like italic and oblique.
- **Font Width:** This is the horizontal space occupied by characters, like condensed and expanded.
- **Baseline:** This is the imaginary line on which most characters rest.
- **Cap Height:** This is the height of uppercase letters, measured from the baseline to the top.
- **X-height:** This is the average height of lowercase letters, excluding ascenders and descenders.
- **Ascenders:** These are the parts of lowercase letters that extend above the x-height, such as the tops of the letters 'h', 'b', 'd', and 'f'.
- **Descenders:** These are the parts of lowercase letters that extend below the baseline, such as the tails of 'y', 'g', 'p', and 'q'.
- **Kerning:** This is how space is adjusted between specific pairs of characters to improve their readability and aesthetics. For example, reducing the space between the letters A and V.
- **Tracking:** This is how space is adjusted between all characters in a block of text. It's essentially the distance between the characters. It affects how dense and open the text will be.
- **Leading:** This is the vertical space between lines of text. It's measured from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next line.
