### Working with Different Attribute Selectors and Links
- **Definition:** The `attribute` selector allows you to target HTML elements based on their attributes like the `href` or `title` attributes.
```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
- **`title` Attribute:** This attribute provides additional information about an element. Here is how you can target links with the `title` attribute:
```css
a[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```
- **Combine selectors to match links that have both `href` and `title` attributes:** Combines multiple attribute selectors.
```css
a[href][title] {
  color: green;
}
```
- **Match a single word within a space-separated list:** Targets links that have a specific class word.
```css
a[class~="primary"] {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
