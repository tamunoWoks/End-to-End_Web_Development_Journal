### Working with Different Attribute Selectors and Links
- **Definition:** The `attribute` selector allows you to target HTML elements based on their attributes like the `href` or `title` attributes.
```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
- **`title` Attribute:** This attribute provides additional information about an element. Here is how you can target links with the `title` attribute:
```css
a[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```
- **Combine selectors to match links that have both `href` and `title` attributes:** Combines multiple attribute selectors.
```css
a[href][title] {
  color: green;
}
```
- **Match a single word within a space-separated list:** Targets links that have a specific class word.
```css
a[class~="primary"] {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
- **Match values that start with a specific prefix:** Targets links starting with `https://`.
```css
a[href^="https://"] {
  color: green;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
- **Match values that end with a specific suffix:** Targets links ending with `.jpg`.
```csss
a[href$=".jpg"] {
  color: darkgreen;
  text-decoration: underline dotted;
}
```
- **Match values that contain a substring anywhere:** Targets links that contain https anywhere in the value.
```css
a[href*="https"] {
  color: teal;
}
```
- **Summary:** These patterns make it easy to consistently style links based on their attributes and values.

### Targeting Elements with the lang and data-lang Attribute
- **`lang` Attribute:** This attribute is used in HTML to specify the language of the content within an element. You might want to style elements differently based on the language they are written in, especially on a multilingual website.
```css
p[lang="en"] {
  font-style: italic;
}
```
