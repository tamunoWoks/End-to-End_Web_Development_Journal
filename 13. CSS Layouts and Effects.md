### CSS Overflow Property
- **Definition:** Overflow refers to the way elements handle content that exceeds, or "overflows", the size of the containing element. Overflow is two-dimensional.
- **`overflow-x`:** The x-axis determines horizontal overflow.
- **`overflow-y`:** the y-axis determines vertical overflow.
- **`overflow`:** Shorthand property for `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`. If given one value, both overflows will use it. If given two values, the `overflow-x` will use the first, and the `overflow-y` will use the second.

### CSS Transform Property
- **Definition:** This property enables you to apply various transformations to elements, such as rotating, scaling, skewing, or translating (moving) them in 2D or 3D space.
- **`translate()` Function:** This function is used to move an element from its current position.
- **`scale()` Function:** This function allows you to change the size of an element.
- **`rotate()` Function:** This function allows you to rotate an element.
- **`skew()` Function:** This function allows you to skew an element.
- **Transforms and Accessibility:** If you're using transform to hide or reveal content, make sure that the content is still accessible to screen readers and keyboard navigation. Hidden content should be truly hidden, such as by using `display:` none or `visibility: hidden` rather than simply being visually moved off-screen.
