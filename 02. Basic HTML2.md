### Boilerplate and Encoding
#### HTML boilerplate: 
This is a template that includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->
  </body>
</html>
```
- **`DOCTYPE`:** This is used to tell browsers which version of HTML you're using.
- **`html` Element:** This represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. To specify the language for the document, you should use the `lang` attribute.
- **`head` Element:** The `head` section contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
- **`meta` Elements:** These elements represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more.
- **`title` Element:** This element is used to set the text that appears in the browser tab or window.
- **`UTF-8` character encoding:** `UTF-8`, or _UCS Transformation Format 8_, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. The `charset` attribute is used inside of a `meta` element to set the character encoding to `UTF-8`.

### SEO and Social Sharing
- **SEO:** Search Engine Optimization is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines.
- **Meta (`description`) Element:** This is used to provide a short description for the web page and impacting SEO.
```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
```
#### Open Graph tags: 
The open graph protocol enables you to control how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with your content. You can set these properties through a collection of `meta` elements inside your HTML head section.
- **`og:title` Property:** This is used to set the `title` that displays for social media posts.
```html
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />
```
- **`og:type` Property:** The `type` property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media. Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.
```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
```
- **`og:image` Property:** This is used to set the image shown for social media posts.
```html
<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>
```
- **`og:url` Property:** This is used to set the URL that users will click on for the social media posts.
```html
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />
```
### Media Elements and Optimization
- **Replaced elements:** A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself. An example would be an `iframe` element. iframe stands for _inline frame_. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page.
```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>
```
You can include the `allowfullscreen` attribute which allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode.
```html
<iframe
  src="video-url"
  width="width-value"
  height="height-value"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```
To embed a video within an `iframe` you can copy it directly from popular video services like YouTube and Vimeo, or define it yourself with the `src` attribute pointing to the URL of that video. Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube:
```html
<h1>A freeCodeCamp YouTube Video Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="YouTube video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```
There are some other replaced elements, such as `video`, and `embed`. And some elements behave as replaced elements under specific circumstances. Here's an example of an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to image:
```html
<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">
```
- **Optimizing media:** There are three tools to consider when using media, such as images, on your web pages: the size, the format, and the compression. A compression algorithm is used to reduce the size for files or data.
- **Image formats:** Two of the most common file formats are `PNG` and `JPG`, but these are no longer the most ideal formats for serving images. Unless you need support for older browsers, you should consider using a more optimized format, like `WEBP` or `AVIF`.
- **Image licenses:** An image under the public domain has no copyright attached to it and is free to be used without any restrictions. Images licensed specifically under the Creative Commons 0 license are considered public domain. Some images might be released under a permissive license, like a Creative Commons license, or the BSD license that freeCodeCamp uses.
- **SVGs:** Scalable Vector Graphics track data based on paths and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an `SVG`, can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality.
