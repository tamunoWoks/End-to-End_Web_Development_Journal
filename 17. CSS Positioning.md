### Working With Floats
- **Definition:** Floats are used to remove an element from its normal flow on the page and position it either on the left or right side of its container. When this happens, the text will wrap around that floated content.
```css
float: left;
float: right;
```
- **Clearing Floats:** The `clear` property is used to determine if an element needs to be moved below the floated content. When you have multiple floated elements stacked next to each other, there could be issues with overlap and collapsing in the layouts. So a `clearfix` hack was created to fix this issue.
```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```
### Static, Relative and Absolute Positioning
- **Static Positioning:** This is the normal flow for the document. Elements are positioned from top to bottom and left to right one after another.
- **Relative Positioning:** This allows you to use the `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom` properties to position the element within the normal document flow. You can also use relative positioning to make elements overlap with other elements on the page.
```css
.relative {
    position: relative;
    top: 30px;
    left: 30px;
}
```
- **Absolute Positioning:** This allows you to take an element out of the normal document flow, making it behave independently from other elements.
```csss
.positioned {
  position: absolute;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
  background-color: coral;
}
```
