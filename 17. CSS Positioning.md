### Working With Floats
- **Definition:** Floats are used to remove an element from its normal flow on the page and position it either on the left or right side of its container. When this happens, the text will wrap around that floated content.
```css
float: left;
float: right;
```
- **Clearing Floats:** The `clear` property is used to determine if an element needs to be moved below the floated content. When you have multiple floated elements stacked next to each other, there could be issues with overlap and collapsing in the layouts. So a `clearfix` hack was created to fix this issue.
```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```
