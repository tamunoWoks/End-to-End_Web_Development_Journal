### Styling Lists
- **`line-height` Property:** This property is used to create space between lines of text. The accepted line-height values include the keyword `normal`, number, percentages and length units like the `em` unit.
- **`list-style-type` Property:** This property is used to specify the marker for a list item. Acceptable values can include a circle, disc, or decimal.
- **`list-style-position` Property:** This property is used to set the position for the list marker. The only two acceptable values are inside and outside.
- **`list-style-image` Property:** This property is used to use an image for the list item marker. A common use case is to use the `url` function with a value set to a valid image location.

### Spacing list items using margin
- Apart from `line-height`, margins can also be used in CSS to enhance the spacing and readability of list items.
- Margins create space outside each `li` element, allowing control over the gap between list items.
- `margin-bottom` is used to create space below each list item. For example, `margin-bottom: 10px;` will create a 10-pixel gap below each list item.
